---------------

* update `get_publications` and `get_article_cite_history` according to the change of Google Scholar (thanks @guangchuangyu)

scholar 0.1.4   (21 November 2015)
---------------

* Fixed bug with missing cookies that was preventing data from being
  downloaded.

* Converted code from XML to rvest/dplyr for legibility

* For clarity, `get_publications` now uses `cid` as the name of the
  column used to link to a publication's full citation history.  This
  avoids any confusion when you add the scholar's id, which is `id`
  elsewhere in the package.

---------------

* Added a `get_article_cite_history` function to get the citation
  history of a single article (#6, thanks @mkiang)

  publications will be fetched.

* Improved performance of large numbers of publications (#15, thanks
  @jefferis)

  to Daniel Acuna for providing the necessary regression coefficients.
