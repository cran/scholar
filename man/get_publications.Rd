\description{
Gets the publications of a specified scholar.
}
\details{
Google uses two id codes to uniquely reference a
publication.  The results of this method includes \code{id} which
can be used to link to a publication's full citation history
(i.e. if you click on the number of citations in the main scholar
profile page), and \code{pubid} which links to the details of the
publication (i.e. if you click on the title of the publication in
the main scholar profile page.)
