\description{
Compares the careers of multiple scholars based on their citation
histories.  The scholar's \emph{career} is defined by the number
of citations to his or her work in a given year (i.e. the bar
chart at the top of a scholar's profile). The function has an
\code{career} option that allows users to compare scholars
directly, i.e. relative to the first year in which their
publications are cited.
