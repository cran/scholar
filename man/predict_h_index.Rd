\description{
Predicts the h-index for a researcher each year for ten years into
the future using Acuna et al's method (see source).  The model was
fit to data from neuroscience researchers with an h-index greater
than 5 and between 5 to 12 years since publishing their first
article.  So naturally if this isn't you, then the results should
be taken with a large pinch of salt.  For more caveats, see
\url{http://simplystatistics.org/2012/10/10/whats-wrong-with-the-predicting-h-index-paper/}.
}
\details{
Since the model is calibrated to neuroscience
researchers, it is entirely possible that very strange
(e.g. negative) h-indices will be predicted if you are a
researcher in another field.  A warning will be displayed if the
sequence of predicted h-indices contains a negative value or is
non-increasing.
}
\note{
A scientist has an h-index of n if he or she publishes n
papers with at least n citations each.  Values returned are
fractional so it's up to your own vanity whether you want to round
up or down.
